# SwiftStateTreeTransportTests

Unit and integration tests for the Transport layer.

**Note:** JWT payload passing to the OnJoin handler (formerly covered by `TransportAdapterJWTPayloadTests`) can be covered by integration tests or by a future Hummingbird integration package if needed. JWT error handling remains in `TransportAdapterJWTErrorHandlingTests`.
