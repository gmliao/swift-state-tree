## About This Document

This document is the result of a deep research and analysis process conducted with the assistance of AI tools.

AI was used as a research accelerator for:
- literature exploration and cross-referencing
- hypothesis expansion and counter-argument generation
- structural organization of complex architectural concepts

All conclusions, architectural judgments, and trade-off decisions were made by the author based on engineering experience and critical evaluation.
This document should be considered an engineering research note rather than an academic proof.
